Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: [COLUMNS]
2. Statistics:
[STATISTICS_DESC] - add outlier detection

We want to predict [TARGET_NODE] with a regression model.

Please analyze the dataset characteristics and the task description, and recommend the most suitable one regression algorithm. Use the following context information to inform your recommendations:

Based on the characteristics of your data and requirements, consider the following priority order for selecting regressors:
1. If your data is linear:
   - Use LinearRegressor for small dataset 
   - Use ElasticNet for high-dimensional dataset and Scenarios where feature selection is important.  
   - Use SGDRegressor for large dataset
   - Use HuberRegressor for dataset with many outliers 
   
2. If your data is non-linear:
   - Use RandomForestRegressor for small to medium dataset or interpretability is important
   - Use HistGradientBoostingRegressor for Large-scale and high dimensional datasets

You can only choose from these Regressors, and use exactly the same name in your response:
[ALGO_CONTEXT]

For the chosen one algorithm, provide:
1. Regressors name (name of the available regressor in the implementation)
2. Brief description
3. Justification for its suitability based on the dataset characteristics

Present your recommendation in a structured JSON format, provide only the most suitable one algorithm given the dataset characteristics.
**You can only choose from these Regressors**:
- LinearRegression
- ElasticNet
- RandomForestRegressor
- HistGradientBoostingRegressor
- HuberRegressor
- SGDRegressor

Please structure your response like this example, DO NOT include anything else:

{
  "name": "Regressor Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the regressor.",
  "justification": "Explanation of why this regressor is suitable for the given dataset.",
}
