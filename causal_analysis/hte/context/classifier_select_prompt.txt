Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: [COLUMNS]
2. Statistics:
[STATISTICS_DESC]

We want to predict [TARGET_NODE] with a classification model.

Please analyze the dataset characteristics and the task description, and recommend the most suitable one classification algorithm. Use the following context information to inform your recommendations:

Based on the characteristics of your data and requirements, consider the following priority order for selecting classifiers:
1. If your data is linear:
   - Use LogisticRegression for small dataset 
   - Use SGDClassifier for large dataset
   
2. If your data is non-linear:
   - Use RandomForestClassifier for small to medium dataset or interpretability is important
   - Use SVC for small to medium dataset if you think kernel method is appropriate
   - Use HistGradientBoostingClassifier for Large-scale and high dimensional datasets
   
You can only choose from these Classifiers, and use exactly the same name in your response:
[ALGO_CONTEXT]

For the chosen one algorithm, provide:
1. Classifier name (name of the available classifier in the implementation)
2. Brief description
3. Justification for its suitability based on the dataset characteristics

Present your recommendation in a structured JSON format, provide only the most suitable algorithm given the dataset characteristics.
**You can only choose from these Regressors**:
- LogisticRegression  
- RandomForestClassifier  
- HistGradientBoostingClassifier  
- SVC 
- SGDClassifier  

Please structure your response like this example, DO NOT include anything else:

{
  "name": "classifier Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the classifier.",
  "justification": "Explanation of why this classifier is suitable for the given dataset.",
}
