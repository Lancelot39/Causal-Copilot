Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: [COLUMNS]
2. Statistics:
[STATISTICS_DESC]

We want to conduct the following Heterogeneous Effect Estimation task:
[QUESTION]

Please analyze the dataset characteristics and the task description, and recommend the most suitable one HTE estimation algorithm. Use the following context information to inform your recommendations:

Algorithms:
[ALGO_CONTEXT]

For the chosen one algorithm, provide:
1. Algorithm name (name of the available algorithm in the implementation)
2. Brief description
3. Justification for its suitability based on the dataset characteristics

Present your recommendations in a structured JSON format, provide the most suitable algorithm given the dataset characteristics.

Please structure your response like this example, DO NOT include anything else:

{
  "name": "Algorithm Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the algorithm.",
  "justification": "Explanation of why this algorithm is suitable for the given dataset.",
}
