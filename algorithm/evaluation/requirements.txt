# Evaluation Protocol

# Update (2024/11/30)

- The simulation currently do not consider hidden confounders
- The algorithms currently do not use PAG as output (exclude FCI)

# General Rules

- Input type: an asymmetry numpy array with the index as entries labelling the edge type
    - Note: If the array has symmetric entries, then it needs to be processed to asymmetric by keeping the (i, j) one
        - If (i, j) == (j, i), remove the (j, i)
- After sampling to DAGs, examine the average metrics across the sampled instances
- The evaluation for time-series is executed from two perspectives:
    - Summary graph (summarized from all time-delayed graphs)
    - Instantaneous graph (only applicable to parts of algorithms)

## Evaluation Logic

- Consider the case that algorithms outputting PAG are rare and we have possible included them (FCI, tsFCI), from efficiency perspective, we do not consider the PAG’s edge type in evaluation.
- Metrics:
    - Pairwise: Precision/Recall/F1
    - Graph: SHD
- For dataset has hidden confounders, sample MAGs to evaluate
    - Average metrics across 1000 MAGs
- For dataset does not any hidden confounders, sample DAGs to evaluate
    - Average metrics across 1000 DAGs
- Edge type
    - No edge
