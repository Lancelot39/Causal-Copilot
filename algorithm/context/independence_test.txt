- **Fisher's Z (fisherz):**
    - **Description**:
    Fisher's Z test is a parametric test based on the correlation between variables. It transforms the correlation coefficient into a Z-score to evaluate the null hypothesis that two variables are conditionally independent given a set of conditioning variables.
        
    - **Assumptions**:
        - The data follows a Gaussian distribution.
        - The relationships between variables are linear.
    - **Advantages**:
        - Efficient and straightforward to implement, particularly for Gaussian data.
        - Well-suited for small to moderately sized datasets.
    - **Limitations**:
        - Assumes linearity and Gaussianity, which may not hold in all datasets.
        - Performance degrades with non-linear relationships or non-Gaussian distributions.
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of samples. Very fast, especially for small to medium-sized datasets.

- **Chi-Squared (chisq):**
    - **Description:**
    The Chi-squared test is a non-parametric test commonly used for discrete data. It evaluates the independence of categorical variables by comparing the observed frequency distribution with the expected frequency distribution under the null hypothesis.
    - **Assumptions**:
        - The data is categorical.
        - The test is more reliable with a sufficiently large sample size.
    - **Advantages**:
        - Suitable for categorical data, making it versatile for various types of datasets.
        - Non-parametric, so it does not assume a specific distribution of the data.
    - **Limitations**:
        - Requires large sample sizes to be reliable.
        - May not be suitable for continuous data without discretization.
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of samples. Fast, especially for categorical data.

- **G-Squared (gsq)**
    - **Description**:
    The G-squared test is another non-parametric test for categorical data, similar to the Chi-squared test. It is based on the likelihood ratio and is particularly useful for large sample sizes.
    - **Assumptions**:
        - The data is categorical or has been discretized.
        - Assumes large sample sizes for reliable inference.
    - **Advantages**:
        - More powerful than the Chi-squared test in some cases, especially with large datasets.
        - Suitable for categorical data and provides a likelihood-based measure of independence.
    - **Limitations**:
        - Requires large sample sizes to be effective.
        - May not be as interpretable or straightforward as the Chi-squared test for small sample sizes.
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of samples. Similar efficiency to Chi-squared test.

- **Missing-value Fisher's Z Conditional Independence Test (mv_fisherz)**
    - **Description**:
    A variant of the Fisher's Z test designed to handle datasets with missing values. It uses testwise deletion or other correction techniques to adjust for missing data.
    - **Assumptions**:
        - The data is Gaussian, and the relationships are linear.
        - The missing data mechanism is Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) or Missing at Random (MAR).
    - **Advantages**:
        - Extends the applicability of Fisher's Z to datasets with missing values.
        - Can maintain statistical power despite missing data.
    - **Limitations**:
        - Still assumes linearity and Gaussianity.
        - Performance may degrade if the missing data mechanism is not well understood or handled.
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of non-missing samples. Slightly slower than standard Fisher's Z due to missing value handling, but still relatively fast.
