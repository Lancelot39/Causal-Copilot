Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: [COLUMNS]
2. Statistics:
[STATISTICS INFO]

We have selected the following algorithm for causal discovery:

Algorithm: [ALGORITHM_NAME]
Description: [ALGORITHM_DESCRIPTION]

Now, we need to set up the primary hyperparameters for this algorithm. Please consider the dataset characteristics and the algorithm requirements to suggest appropriate values for the following hyperparameters:

[PRIMARY_HYPERPARAMETERS]

For each primary hyperparameter, provide:
1. The full name of the hyperparameter that is aligned with your understanding ('independence test', 'max depth', 'score function', etc.)
2. The suggested value
3. A brief explanation of why this value is appropriate given the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements
4. Each primary hyperparameter is provided with a default value, which should be adjusted based on the dataset characteristics and algorithm requirements

Use the following information about each hyperparameter to inform your decisions:

[HYPERPARAMETER_INFO]

Please provide your suggestions in a structured JSON format. Your response should look like this:

{
  "algorithm": "[ALGORITHM_NAME]",
  "hyperparameters": {
    "[HYPERPARAMETER_1_NAME]": {
      "full_name": "[HYPERPARAMETER_1_FULL_NAME]",
      "value": [SUGGESTED_VALUE],
      "explanation": "[BRIEF_EXPLANATION]"
    },
    "[HYPERPARAMETER_2_NAME]": {
      "full_name": "[HYPERPARAMETER_2_FULL_NAME]",
      "value": [SUGGESTED_VALUE],
      "explanation": "[BRIEF_EXPLANATION]"
    },
    ...
  }
}

Please always determine the hyperparameters from its corresponding "Suggested Values" part, DO NOT use any values just exist in other context but not in "Suggested Values".

Please consider the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency when suggesting values. If you're unsure about a specific value, you may suggest using the default value and explain why.

Please provide your hyperparameter suggestions following this JSON structure.
