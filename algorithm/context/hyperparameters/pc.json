    "reasoning": "Adjust based on the scale of data. Lower gamma (0.1) for small-scale data with low variance, and higher gamma (1.0) for high-variance data. Default (0.5) works well for most cases."

    "reasoning": "Use -1 for unlimited depth. For large graphs, limit depth (e.g., 1-3) to significantly speed up the algorithm at the cost of some accuracy. For graphs with < 10 nodes, use depth 6; for 10-25 nodes, use depth 4; for 25-50 nodes, use depth 2; for > 50 nodes, use depth 1."
