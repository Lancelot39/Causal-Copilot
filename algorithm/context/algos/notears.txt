### NOTEARS

- **Description**: NOTEARS transforms the combinatorial problem of learning Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) into a continuous optimization problem.

- **Assumptions**:
    - **Acyclicity**: The underlying causal structure is a DAG.
    - **Linearity and Additivity**: Basic form assumes linear and additive relationships.
    - **Gaussian Noise**: Assumes Gaussian noise terms.
    - **No Hidden Confounders**: All relevant variables are observed.

- **Advantages**:
    - **Scalability**: Efficiently scales to large datasets using continuous optimization.
    - **Flexibility**: Can be extended to various types of data relationships.

- **Limitations**:
    - **Sensitivity to Model Assumptions**: Performance depends on model and loss function choice.
    - **Computational Complexity**: Can be demanding for very large variable sets (>1000).

- **Suitable Cases**:
    - **High-dimensional Data**: Where traditional combinatorial methods struggle.
    - **Nonlinear Causal Relationships**: Can be adapted for nonlinear scenarios.
