### GES

- **Description**: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a score-based causal discovery algorithm that identifies the optimal causal structure by navigating the space of equivalence classes of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

- **Assumptions**:
    - **Causal Sufficiency**: All relevant variables are observed, no hidden confounders.
    - **Faithfulness**: The observed statistical dependencies correspond to true causal relationships.
    - **Markov Condition**: Every variable is conditionally independent of its non-effects given its direct causes.
    - **No Cycles**: The causal structure is assumed to be acyclic.

- **Advantages**:
    - **Efficiency in Complex Search Spaces**: Efficiently navigates large search spaces using equivalence class representation.
    - **Versatility**: Can use various score functions (BIC or generalized scores).
    - **Global Optimization**: Optimizes a global criterion through local steps.

- **Limitations**:
    - **Parametric Assumptions**: BIC score assumes Gaussianity and linearity.
    - **Computational Demands**: Generalized scoring functions can be computationally intensive.
    - **Output**: Produces a Markov equivalence class rather than a single DAG.

- **Suitable Cases**:
    - **Large-Scale Data with Gaussian/Linear Assumptions**: Efficient with BIC score.
    - **Complex, Non-Gaussian Data**: Can use generalized score functions.
    - **Applications Requiring Global Optimization**: High-dimensional causal discovery tasks.
