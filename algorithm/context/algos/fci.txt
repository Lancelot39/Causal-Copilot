### FCI

- **Description**: FCI is an extension of the PC algorithm designed to handle the presence of hidden confounders. It outputs a Partial Ancestral Graph (PAG) representing causal relationships with hidden variables.
- **Assumptions**
    - **Faithfulness**: The observed dependencies reflect the underlying causal graph.
    - **Markov Condition**: Each variable is independent of its non-effects given its direct causes.
- **Advantages**
    - Accommodate  the existence of hidden confounders
- **Limitations**:
    - Similar to PC's limitations
    - Computationally more intensive than the PC algorithm.
    - Like PC, it identifies a PAG, which is less informative than a full DAG.
