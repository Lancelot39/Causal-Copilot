    "expert_suggestion": "Use -1 as default. For graphs with <10 nodes, use -1 (no limit) to explore all possibilities. For 10-25 nodes, limit maxP to 3. For 25-50 nodes, use maxP=5. For >50 nodes, use maxP=7 to reduce computational complexity. Each additional parent can increase runtime exponentially."
