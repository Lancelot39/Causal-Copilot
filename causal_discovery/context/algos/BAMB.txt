# BAMB Algorithm

## Executive Summary
- **Optimal use scenarios:** Feature selection tasks requiring Markov Blanket discovery, moderate to large sample sizes (>1000), balanced computational efficiency and accuracy needs
- **Alternative recommendations:** GRaSP for high measurement error, PC with KCI for small samples, CDNOD for non-linear relationships

## 1. Real-World Applications
- **Best Use Cases:** Feature selection in high-dimensional datasets, genomics data analysis for gene regulatory networks, medical feature selection requiring minimal but comprehensive predictive variable sets
- **Limitations:** Underperforms with small samples (<500), less effective than global methods for complete causal graph recovery, struggles with significant unmeasured confounding

## 2. Assumptions
- **Core theoretical assumptions:** Causal Markov condition, faithfulness, causal sufficiency (no unmeasured common causes), reliable conditional independence testing
- **Effects of assumption violations:** Performance degrades significantly with hidden confounders, accuracy depends on reliability of conditional independence tests which can fail with small samples

## 3. Data Handling Capabilities
- **Performance across data types:** Accommodates continuous, discrete, or mixed data through appropriate independence test selection
- **Handling of relationship complexity:** Primarily designed for linear relationships with "fisherz" test; adaptable to discrete data (chi-square) and nonlinear relationships through nonparametric tests (KCI, RCIT)
- **Noise tolerance:** Handles both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise with appropriate test selection, though shows inconsistent performance with non-Gaussian noise

## 4. Robustness & Scalability
- **Missing data tolerance:** Moderate sensitivity to missing data, requiring preprocessing for gaps exceeding 10%
- **Measurement error resilience:** Limited tolerance compared to score-based alternatives
- **Network density performance:** Balanced performance across graph densities
- **Variable and sample scaling:** Can handle up to a few thousand variables with appropriate test selection
- **Multi-domain data handling:** Moderate capability for handling heterogeneous data

## 5. Computational Complexity
- **Theoretical time complexity:** Similar to other constraint-based methods
- **Practical runtime characteristics:** Efficiency close to IAMB but faster than complex MB algorithms like MMMB or HITON-MB
- **Memory usage:** Moderate, depends primarily on variable count and sample size

## 6. Hyperparameters
- **Key hyperparameters:** α (significance level) and indep_test (independence test method)
- **Default performance:** Default values (α = 0.05, indep_test = "fisherz") provide acceptable performance in standard cases
- **Tuning difficulty:** Moderate with clear heuristics available based on sample size and data type
- **Impact of incorrect settings:** Inappropriate independence test selection can significantly reduce accuracy; too conservative or liberal α values can lead to missing true edges or including false edges

## 7. Interpretability
- **Output format:** Produces Markov Blanket for target variable(s) - parents, children, and spouses
- **Confidence measures:** Limited to independence test p-values
- **Ambiguity handling:** Does not explicitly handle causal ambiguities
