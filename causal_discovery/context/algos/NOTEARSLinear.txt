# NOTEARSLinear Algorithm

## Executive Summary
- **Optimal for**: Linear continuous-variable problems with sparse to moderate graph density (≤0.3); medium-sized networks (<200 variables); domains needing complete DAG structure
- **Alternatives**: GES for better scalability; CDNOD with RCIT for nonlinear relationships; PC with KCI for mixed data types

## 1. Assumptions
- True causal structure is a DAG (no cycles or feedback loops)
- Causal sufficiency (no unmeasured confounders)
- Linear relationships between variables
- Independent noise terms
- Continuous variables only

## 2. Data Handling Capabilities
- **Variable Types**: Designed exclusively for continuous variables; no native support for discrete/categorical data
- **Functional Complexity**: Limited to linear relationships; cannot capture nonlinear effects without extensions
- **Noise Characteristics**: Performs well with Gaussian noise; moderately robust to other noise distributions

## 3. Robustness & Scalability
- **Missing Data**: Requires pre-processing with imputation; no built-in handling of missing values
- **Measurement Error**: Moderate tolerance to random noise; performance degrades with structured measurement errors
- **Network Density**: Excels with sparse to moderate causal graphs (edge probability ≤0.3)
- **Variable Scaling**: Practical for networks with up to a few hundred variables; performance stable from 5-200 nodes
- **Multi-Domain Data**: Limited native support for heterogeneous or multi-domain data

## 4. Computational Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(d³) where d is number of variables; prohibitive beyond 1000 variables
- **Memory Usage**: O(d²) for storing adjacency matrix; efficient for medium-sized networks
- **Implementation Efficiency**: Leverages numerical optimization libraries; supports GPU acceleration for matrix operations

## 5. Hyperparameters
- **Key Parameters**: lambda1 (λ1) for sparsity control; w_threshold for edge pruning; loss_type for model specification
- **Default Performance**: Default values (λ1=0.01, w_threshold=0.3) provide reasonable results in standard scenarios
- **Tuning Difficulty**: Straightforward compared to many causal algorithms; λ1 tuning provides clear feedback signal
- **Incorrect Settings Impact**: Overly high λ1 prunes legitimate edges; too low creates dense graphs with false positives

## 6. Real-World Applications
- **Best Use Cases**: Gene regulatory networks with linear relationships; financial market analysis for sparse causal networks; Earth science time series with moderate dimensions
- **Limitations**: Poor performance on systems with strong nonlinear interactions; unsuitable for very large networks (>1000 variables); underperforms with feedback loops or cyclic causation

## 7. Interpretability
- **Output Format**: Fully oriented weighted adjacency matrix representing a complete DAG
- **Confidence Measures**: No built-in statistical significance or uncertainty quantification
- **Ambiguity Handling**: Produces definitive edge directions without representing uncertainty
- **User Accessibility**: Direct interpretation of causal strengths via edge weights
- **Validation Methods**: Requires external validation approaches (bootstrap, intervention data)
