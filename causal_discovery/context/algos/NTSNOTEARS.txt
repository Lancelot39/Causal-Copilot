# NTS-NOTEARS

## Hyperparameters Sensitivity
- **Number of Hyperparameters**: High (8-10 key parameters)
- **Default Performance**: Requires careful tuning for good performance
- **Tuning Difficulty**: High - neural network and regularization parameters need dataset-specific tuning

## Robustness & Scalability
- **Data Quality Tolerance**: More robust to various noise distributions than linear methods
- **Scalability**: Moderate - handles medium-sized networks but with high computational cost
- **Computational Cost**: O(nÂ² log n) complexity with significant constants due to neural network training

## Mixed Data & Complex Functions
- **Functional Assumptions**: Captures nonlinear causal relationships via neural networks
- **Noise Assumptions**: Flexible - handles non-Gaussian noise well
- **Data Type Handling**: Primarily for continuous data, extensions needed for categorical variables

## Interpretability
- **Output Format**: Time-lagged directed graph with edge strengths
- **Edge Meanings**: Edge strengths reflect complex nonlinear relationships
- **Uncertainty Metrics**: Limited support for uncertainty quantification

## Assumptions
- **Critical Assumptions**: Acyclicity within time slices, causal sufficiency, stationarity
- **Robustness to Violations**: More robust to functional form violations than linear methods
- **Requirement Level**: Core acyclicity assumption cannot be relaxed

## Real-World Applications
- **Successful Domains**: Sports analytics (ice hockey event analysis), manufacturing process analysis
- **Performance Limitations**: Requires substantial data for reliable neural network training
- **Scientific Evidence**: Validated on professional ice hockey game data and ceramic substrate manufacturing process data

These profiles highlight the distinctive characteristics of each algorithm to help an LLM agent select the most appropriate one based on data characteristics and application requirements.
