# DYNOTEARS

## Real-World Applications
- **Successful Domains**: Neuroscience (fMRI data analysis), sports analytics (NHL event analysis)
- **Performance Limitations**: Less effective for highly nonlinear systems or data with many hidden confounders
- **Scientific Evidence**: Validated on resting-state human fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project

## Hyperparameters Sensitivity
- **Number of Hyperparameters**: Moderate (5-7 key parameters)
- **Default Performance**: Decent with default settings, regularization parameters require tuning
- **Tuning Difficulty**: Medium - regularization parameters (λ_w, λ_a) require careful adjustment

## Robustness & Scalability
- **Data Quality Tolerance**: Handles moderate noise well, sensitive to outliers
- **Scalability**: Good for medium-sized graphs (up to 50-100 variables)
- **Computational Cost**: O(n²) complexity; highly dependent on lookback window length

## Mixed Data & Complex Functions
- **Functional Assumptions**: Assumes linear causal relationships
- **Noise Assumptions**: Assumes Gaussian noise, but somewhat robust to violations
- **Data Type Handling**: Primarily for continuous variables, extensions exist for discrete data

## Interpretability
- **Output Format**: Time-lagged directed acyclic graph (DAG)
- **Edge Meanings**: Edge weights directly represent causal effect strengths
- **Uncertainty Metrics**: Limited support for uncertainty quantification

## Assumptions
- **Critical Assumptions**: Acyclicity within time slices, causal sufficiency, stationarity
- **Robustness to Violations**: Moderate sensitivity to non-stationarity and hidden confounders
- **Requirement Level**: Core acyclicity assumption cannot be relaxed
