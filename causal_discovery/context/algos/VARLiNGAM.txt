# VARLiNGAM

## Hyperparameters Sensitivity
- **Number of Hyperparameters**: Moderate (3-5 key parameters)
- **Default Performance**: Good on datasets with non-Gaussian noise, but requires lag selection
- **Tuning Difficulty**: Moderate - lag selection is crucial but can be guided by domain knowledge

## Robustness & Scalability
- **Data Quality Tolerance**: Sensitive to noise and outliers; requires complete data
- **Scalability**: Scales well for moderate dimensions (10-30 variables), struggles with high dimensions
- **Computational Cost**: O(n² × lags) complexity, where n is number of variables

## Mixed Data & Complex Functions
- **Functional Assumptions**: Assumes linear causal relationships between variables
- **Noise Assumptions**: Specifically designed for non-Gaussian noise distributions
- **Data Type Handling**: Primarily for continuous data; requires preprocessing for discrete variables

## Interpretability
- **Output Format**: Fully directed graph showing both contemporaneous and time-lagged causal effects
- **Edge Meanings**: Edge weights represent direct causal effect strengths
- **Uncertainty Metrics**: Limited support for confidence intervals on causal effects

## Assumptions
- **Critical Assumptions**: Non-Gaussian noise, linear relationships, stationarity, causal sufficiency
- **Robustness to Violations**: Sensitive to Gaussian noise, non-stationarity, and hidden confounders
- **Requirement Level**: Core assumptions (non-Gaussianity) cannot be relaxed

## Real-World Applications
- **Successful Domains**: Economics (firm growth analysis), finance (monetary policy effects), neuroimaging with non-Gaussian signals
- **Performance Limitations**: Underperforms in systems with nonlinear interactions or high dimensions
- **Scientific Evidence**: Successfully applied in macroeconomic studies and financial time series analysis
