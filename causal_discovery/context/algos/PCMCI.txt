# PCMCI

## Hyperparameters Sensitivity
- **Number of Hyperparameters**: Higher (7-10 key parameters)
- **Default Performance**: Good with default settings for most datasets
- **Tuning Difficulty**: Lower - significance levels can be set conservatively and still work well

## Robustness & Scalability
- **Data Quality Tolerance**: Robust to autocorrelation; handles moderate noise well
- **Scalability**: Excellent for high-dimensional data (hundreds of variables)
- **Computational Cost**: O(n² × τ_max) complexity, but with efficient pruning strategies

## Mixed Data & Complex Functions
- **Functional Assumptions**: Flexible - can detect linear and nonlinear relationships with appropriate tests
- **Noise Assumptions**: Accommodates various noise distributions through different independence tests
- **Data Type Handling**: Supports mixed data types with appropriate conditional independence tests

## Interpretability
- **Output Format**: Time-lagged directed graph with p-values and effect sizes
- **Edge Meanings**: Edges represent causal links with statistical significance metrics
- **Uncertainty Metrics**: Provides p-values and confidence intervals for causal effects

## Assumptions
- **Critical Assumptions**: Causal Markov condition, faithfulness, stationarity
- **Robustness to Violations**: More robust to violations than parametric methods
- **Requirement Level**: Some assumptions can be relaxed with extensions (PCMCI+)

## Real-World Applications
- **Successful Domains**: Climate science (Arctic-midlatitude interactions), ecology (biosphere-climate relationships), physiology (sleep data analysis)
- **Performance Limitations**: Computationally intensive for very long time lags or complex independence tests
- **Scientific Evidence**: Extensive validation on climate datasets, including analysis of Arctic drivers of midlatitude winter circulation
