# IAMBnPC Algorithm Profile

## Executive Summary
- **Optimal Use**: Targeted Markov Blanket discovery for specific variables in sparse causal networks with moderate dimensionality and sufficient sample size
- **Alternatives**: PC or GES for discovering complete causal structures

## 1. Real-World Applications
- **Best Use Cases**: 
  - Biomedical gene regulatory network discovery with limited variables
  - Healthcare risk factor identification in clinical datasets
  - Feature selection for predictive modeling with identified target variables
- **Limitations**: 
  - Struggles with high-dimensional genomics data (>1000 variables)
  - Poor performance with dense causal structures
  - Ineffective for systems with significant latent confounders

## 2. Assumptions
- **Core Theoretical Assumptions**:
  - Causal Sufficiency: No unmeasured confounders affecting observed variables
  - Faithfulness: Conditional independencies in data are represented in the graph
  - Markov Condition: Causal structure encodes all conditional independencies
- **Effects of Assumption Violations**:
  - Highly sensitive to violations of causal sufficiency
  - Moderate sensitivity to violations of faithfulness
  - Fails in the presence of selection bias

## 3. Data Handling Capabilities
- **Performance Across Data Types**:
  - Continuous data: Excellent with fisherz test
  - Discrete data: Good with chisq test (requires purely discrete data)
  - Mixed data: Moderate performance with appropriate test selection
- **Handling of Relationship Complexity**:
  - Linear relationships: Strong with fisherz test
  - Nonlinear relationships: Capable with kci/fastkci/rcit tests (at increased computational cost)
- **Noise Tolerance**:
  - Moderate tolerance to Gaussian noise
  - More sensitive to non-Gaussian noise distributions

## 4. Robustness & Scalability
- **Missing Data Tolerance**: Poor (lacks specialized handling mechanisms)
- **Measurement Error Resilience**: Moderate sensitivity
- **Network Density Performance**: 
  - Excels with sparse structures
  - Performance degrades with increasing density
- **Variable and Sample Scaling**:
  - Handles up to hundreds of variables adequately
  - Sample size requirements grow exponentially with Markov Blanket size
- **Multi-domain Data Handling**: Limited built-in capabilities for heterogeneous datasets

## 5. Computational Complexity
- **Theoretical Time Complexity**: O(|MB(T)| × N), where |MB(T)| is the Markov Blanket size and N is the number of variables
- **Practical Runtime**:
  - Fast for sparse networks with small Markov Blankets
  - Becomes prohibitively slow for dense networks or large Markov Blankets
- **Memory Usage**: Moderate; scales with number of variables and sample size
- **Parallelization Potential**: Limited to independence test parallelization
- **Hardware Requirements**: Standard CPU-based computation; no specialized hardware needed

## 6. Hyperparameters
- **Key Hyperparameters**:
  - Significance level (α) for independence testing
  - Independence test selection (indep_test)
- **Default Performance**: Reasonable with defaults (α = 0.05, indep_test = fisherz) for standard datasets
- **Tuning Difficulty**: Moderate to easy
  - α can be selected based on sample size
  - Test selection based on data types and relationship complexity
- **Impact of Incorrect Settings**:
  - Too high α: Increased false positives (spurious edges)
  - Too low α: Increased false negatives (missing edges)
  - Inappropriate test: Failure to detect true dependencies

## 7. Interpretability
- **Output Format**: Markov Blanket for target variables (parents, children, and spouses)
- **Confidence Measures**: P-values from independence tests indicate confidence in edge absence
- **Ambiguity Handling**: Limited built-in capabilities for resolving edge direction ambiguities
- **User Accessibility**: Results directly identify relevant predictors and causal factors
- **Validation Methods**: Cross-validation or hold-out testing for predictive accuracy of identified Markov Blanket
