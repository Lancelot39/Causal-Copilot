# Granger Causality

## Hyperparameters Sensitivity
- **Number of Hyperparameters**: Low (2-3 key parameters)
- **Default Performance**: Simple to implement with reasonable performance on well-behaved data
- **Tuning Difficulty**: Low - lag selection is the main challenge but can be automated with information criteria

## Robustness & Scalability
- **Data Quality Tolerance**: Highly sensitive to noise and non-normality
- **Scalability**: Limited to small/medium systems (<30 variables)
- **Computational Cost**: O(d³p²) for multivariate version, O(d²p) for pairwise version

## Mixed Data & Complex Functions
- **Functional Assumptions**: Strictly linear relationships only
- **Noise Assumptions**: Assumes Gaussian noise distributions
- **Data Type Handling**: Designed for continuous variables only

## Interpretability
- **Output Format**: Simple directed graph showing predictive relationships. Only provides summary graph
- **Edge Meanings**: Edges represent statistical predictability, not necessarily causation
- **Uncertainty Metrics**: Provides p-values but no effect size estimates

## Assumptions
- **Critical Assumptions**: Linearity, Gaussian errors, stationarity, no instantaneous effects
- **Robustness to Violations**: Very sensitive to assumption violations
- **Requirement Level**: Core linearity assumption cannot be relaxed in standard implementation

## Real-World Applications
- **Successful Domains**: Economics (simple financial indicators), neuroscience (basic connectivity analysis)
- **Performance Limitations**: Poor performance on nonlinear systems or data with hidden confounders
- **Scientific Evidence**: Widely used in financial markets analysis (e.g., studying relationships between trading volume and price volatility)
