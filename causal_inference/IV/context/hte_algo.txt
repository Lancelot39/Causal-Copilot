## Algorithms Description

### **DRIV**

- **Description**:  
  The general Doubly Robust Instrumental Variable (DRIV) estimator for estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE). It leverages a valid instrument along with outcome and treatment nuisance models to correct for endogeneity.

- **Key Characteristics**:  
  - Combines modeling of outcomes and treatment assignments with IV correction.
  - Robust if at least one nuisance model is correctly specified.

---

### **LinearDRIV**

- **Description**:  
  A variant of DRIV that uses linear regression in the final stage to estimate the CATE, assuming a linear relationship between covariates and the treatment effect.

- **Key Characteristics**:  
  - Simple and interpretable.
  - Best for low-dimensional settings with a presumed linear effect.

---

### **SparseLinearDRIV**

- **Description**:  
  An extension of LinearDRIV that applies regularization (e.g., Debiased Lasso) to handle high-dimensional or sparse data, selecting only the most relevant covariates.

- **Key Characteristics**:  
  - Automatically performs feature selection.
  - Ideal for high-dimensional scenarios with sparse true effects.

### **ForestDRIV**

- **Description**:  
  A nonparametric variant of DRIV that uses a regression forest in the final stage to flexibly capture complex and nonlinear heterogeneous treatment effects.

- **Key Characteristics**:  
  - Captures highly nonlinear relationships.
  - Requires larger sample sizes and is more computationally intensive.

### **metalearners**

- **Description**:  
  A flexible approach that allows for the use of various machine learning models in both the nuisance and final stages of IV estimation.  
- **Key Characteristics**:  
  - Offers the highest flexibility by combining multiple models.
  - Often used when model selection is automated through cross-validation.
