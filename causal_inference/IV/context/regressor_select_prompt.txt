Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: [COLUMNS]  
2. Statistics: [STATISTICS_DESC]

We want to predict [TARGET_NODE] in the final stage of a Doubly Robust Instrumental Variable (DRIV) framework using a regression model.

Please analyze the dataset characteristics and recommend the most suitable regressor from the following list:
- LinearRegression  
- ElasticNet  
- RandomForestRegressor  
- HistGradientBoostingRegressor  
- HuberRegressor  
- SGDRegressor  

Provide your recommendation in the structured JSON format below:

{
  "name": "Regressor Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the regressor.",
  "justification": "Explanation of why this regressor is suitable for the given dataset."
