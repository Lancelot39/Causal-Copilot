Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: [COLUMNS]  
2. Statistics: [STATISTICS_DESC]

We want to estimate Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) using a Doubly Robust Instrumental Variable (DRIV) framework.

Please analyze the dataset characteristics and recommend the most suitable HTE estimation algorithm from the following list:
- DRIV  
- LinearDRIV  
- SparseLinearDRIV  
- ForestDRIV  
- metalearners  

Provide your recommendation in the structured JSON format below:

{
  "name": "Algorithm Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the algorithm.",
  "justification": "Explanation of why this algorithm is suitable for the given dataset."
