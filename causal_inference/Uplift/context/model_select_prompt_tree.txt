Based on the following information, select the most appropriate tree-based machine learning model to use as the base estimator for uplift modeling.

Dataset Columns:
[COLUMNS]

Dataset Statistics:
[STATISTICS_DESC]

Algorithm Context:
[ALGO_CONTEXT]

Selected Uplift Algorithm: [ALGORITHM_NAME]

Choose the most appropriate tree-based model considering:
1. The nature of the dataset (size, dimensionality, etc.)
2. The requirements of the selected uplift algorithm
3. The potential for overfitting
4. The need for interpretability vs performance
