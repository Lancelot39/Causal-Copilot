Metrics for evaluating uplift models:

1. Qini Coefficient: Measures the area between the uplift curve and a random targeting baseline.
   - Higher values indicate better discrimination of treatment effects
   - Range: [-1, 1] with positive values indicating a model better than random

2. Uplift by Decile: Measures the average treatment effect within each decile of predicted uplift
   - Monotonically decreasing trend indicates good model performance

3. AUUC (Area Under the Uplift Curve): Similar to Qini but uses a different normalization
   - Higher values indicate better model performance

4. Cumulative Gain: Shows the cumulative incremental outcome when targeting individuals sorted by predicted uplift
   - Steeper initial slope indicates better targeting efficiency

5. Expected Response with Random Targeting (ERRT): The baseline random policy performance
   - Used as a reference point for other metrics

When evaluating uplift models, focus on:
1. Model stability (consistent performance across validation folds)
2. Business relevance (targeting cost vs benefit)
3. Calibration (predicted uplift vs observed uplift)
