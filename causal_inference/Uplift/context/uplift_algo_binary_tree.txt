Available algorithms for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (uplift modeling) with a binary treatment, focusing on tree-based methods and meta-learners with tree-based base estimators:

1.  **S-Learner (Single Model) with Tree-Based Base Learner:**
    -   Uses a single tree-based model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict the outcome, including the treatment variable as a feature.
    -   Simple to implement.
    -   Good for capturing general trends and interactions.

2.  **T-Learner (Two Models) with Tree-Based Base Learners:**
    -   Trains two separate tree-based models: one for the treatment group and one for the control group.
    -   The uplift is estimated as the difference in predictions.
    -   Can capture different relationships in treatment and control groups.

3.  **X-Learner with Tree-Based Base Learners:**
    -  Uses tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest) in its two-stage process.
    -   Often performs well and is more robust than T-Learner.

4. **R-Learner with Tree-Based Base Learners**
    - Uses a tree-based learner (e.g., Random Forest) to estimate the CATE by residualizing both treatment and outcome with respect to covariates.

5.  **Uplift Tree/Random Forest:**
    -   Directly optimizes for uplift during tree construction (splitting criteria based on treatment effect differences).
    -   Specifically designed for uplift; interpretable.

6. **Doubly Robust Learner with Tree-Based Base Learners:**
- Uses a tree-based learner in the two-model approach to be resistant to model misspecification.

When choosing, consider the complexity of the relationships in your data and the importance of interpretability.  If the causal graph suggests strong confounding, prioritize X-Learner or R-Learner. If interpretability is key, consider Uplift Trees/Forests or S-Learner with a single decision tree.
