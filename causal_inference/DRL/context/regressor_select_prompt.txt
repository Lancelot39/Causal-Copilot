Given a dataset with the following properties:

1. Columns: [COLUMNS]
2. Statistics:
[STATISTICS_DESC]

We want to predict [TARGET_NODE] with a regression model in the DRL (Doubly Robust Learning) framework.

Please analyze the dataset characteristics and the task description, and recommend the most suitable one regression algorithm. Use the following context information to inform your recommendations:

You can only choose from these Regressors, and use exactly the same name in your response:
[ALGO_CONTEXT]

For the chosen one algorithm, provide:
1. Regressor name (name of the available regressor in the implementation)
2. Brief description
3. Justification for its suitability based on the dataset characteristics

Present your recommendation in a structured JSON format, provide only the most suitable one algorithm given the dataset characteristics.
**You can only choose from these Regressors**:
- LinearRegression
- ElasticNet
- RandomForestRegressor
- HistGradientBoostingRegressor
- HuberRegressor
- SGDRegressor

Please structure your response like this example, DO NOT include anything else:

{
  "name": "Regressor Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the regressor.",
  "justification": "Explanation of why this regressor is suitable for the given dataset.",
}
